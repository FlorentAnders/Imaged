Imaged for Instagram

Official repository of Imaged for Instagram by FA Development.

As Instagram has stopped its API, this app is useless in a way. As I have been a way worse developer than I am today, I can guarantee you that this code will not be the best and may have some structural complexities.

I disallow you to use any of Imaged’s image resources or its name. I would be happy if you could learn something out of it. You will need to adapt a few changes made in the last releases to Android Compilation (Apache HTTP etc.) to build the app.

Please be sure to check out my Android apps that are currently available on Google Play! You can also follow me on Twitter (@FlorentAnders) to be informed about my newest projects and developments!

This app was originally a fork of Kevin Daniel’s Filmstrip, I enjoyed working with him. Here is the original project’s link: https://github.com/kevin-dapps/Filmstrip

THIS SOFTWARE IS LICENSED UNDER THE GPLv3, WHICH YOU NEED TO FOLLOW TOO WHEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT!
